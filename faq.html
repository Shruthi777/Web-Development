                                        <h4>Is Fantasy Games a Skill or Luck?</h4>
                                        <p>Fantasy games are a mixture of 60% skill and 40% luck according to me because it takes a good amount of knowledge of the game to choose the right kind of players in a particular game according to the conditions available & their current form. Luck does play a part but it all the more depends on the knowledge and skill of the concerned fantasy gamer who is selecting those players available in the real upcoming matches.

                                        <h4>Why should I play fantasy games?</h4>
                                        <p> This is an easy one. Playing Fantasy Sports, or more specifically, Fantasy Cricket offers you a thought-provoking way to create your team of superstars as per your fantasy and insights.

By playing these Online Games, you can manoeuvre your players around in a way that their collective and personal synergies are laser-focused towards a unified goal.
                                            What is fantasy cricket?
                                            Fantasy Cricket is just what the name implies- it is a virtual genre of cricket that hinges on fantasy-based selections of top performers.
                                            In it, a player selects a virtual team of 11 players from a total of 30 or so players from two competing teams. He may select them on the basis of their track record, current form, strengths and weaknesses, playing conditions and sometimes even intuition.
                                            This online gaming genre also keeps a reserved space for every player’s own understanding and version of cricket. It is so because different fantasy players may perceive a certain real match player differently and the same perception closely affects their team creation.
                                            Once a player has created a fantasy team, he is also supposed to mark the captain and vice-captain for it. Each of the players that he has chosen receive points on the basis of their performance on the ground. The captain and vice-captain get additional Fantasy Points for every other player’s performance in the team, besides theirs.
